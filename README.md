## Rust Rocket Webapp Template 


This is a very simple web api template in rust that includes:

1) Model-Controller api backend using Rocket 
2) Postgres database with Supabase(remote) or local DB support 


So this is a comprehensive framework with everything you need to get started building a JSON-based api that reads and writes to a database through an HTTP server with custom logic. 


## HOW TO TEST (without postman!)
